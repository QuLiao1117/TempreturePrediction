# TempreturePrediction

In order to predict the future tempreature in the greenhouse,we collected greenhouse data using four different sensors.

The collected data includes several features such as humidity,pressure,wind direction,wind speed,rainfall,ultraviolet,illumination and carbonDioxide.

Good results have already been achieved by us with the help of neural networks and GBDT.Howerver,the data is relatively small and the results still need to be improved.

Your help will definitely be welcomed by us.
